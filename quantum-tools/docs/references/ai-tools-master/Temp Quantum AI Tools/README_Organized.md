# Quantum AI Tools — Organized Extract

Source: QOSF “Open-Source Quantum Software Projects” (README) — extracted and organized on 2026-01-07.

This folder contains a pragmatic split of the source list into:

- Models vs Simulations

Because the source list is open‑source only, there are no “Paid” files in this folder.

## Files

- Models (Open): Models_Open.md
- Simulations (Open): Simulations_Open.md

## Notes

- “Models” groups SDKs, frameworks, and algorithm/QML libraries used to build quantum models.
- “Simulations” groups circuit/state/network simulators and related analog/annealing toolkits.
- If you want, I can create a separate companion list of commercial offerings (AWS Braket managed simulators, IBM paid tiers, Quantinuum, etc.) with links and pricing notes.
