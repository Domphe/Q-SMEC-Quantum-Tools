      "text": "The Hydro Cube\nDual-Cycle TEC Atmospheric Water Generator & Distillation\nSystem\n1. Executive Summary\nThe Hydro Cube is a compact, field-portable dual-cycle water system: it condenses ambient\nhumidity via a 33-fin array cooled by a multi-TEC cold plate, while its hot side is realized as an\nimmersed heatsink in liquid. That liquid bath serves a dual purpose—waste-heat rejection and\nboiling/distillation of condensate or contaminated liquids. The unit runs exclusively on\nthermoelectric energy (no external heaters), with user-selectable TEC modules to trade power vs\noutput. Prototype design targets ~0.28–0.33 L/h at 70 % RH under ideal conditions, with\ndistillation up to ~0.25 L/h possible when boiling. This concept bridges atmospheric water\ngeneration and small-scale distillation in one compact, rugged package.\nUnlike pure AWG units that waste heat, the Hydro Cube stands apart by converting cold and hot\nsides into productive functions. Compared to other military/AWG programs (e.g., DARPA\nAWE, GE’s AIR2WATER, SOURCE Hydropanels), the Hydro Cube’s size, dual use, and\nmodular power control give tactical flexibility and competitive performance in the portable class.\n2.

  "full_text": "The Hydro Cube\nDual-Cycle TEC Atmospheric Water Generator & Distillation\nSystem\n1. Executive Summary\nThe Hydro Cube is a compact, field-portable dual-cycle water system: it condenses ambient\nhumidity via a 33-fin array cooled by a multi-TEC cold plate, while its hot side is realized as an\nimmersed heatsink in liquid. That liquid bath serves a dual purpose—waste-heat rejection and\nboiling/distillation of condensate or contaminated liquids. The unit runs exclusively on\nthermoelectric energy (no external heaters), with user-selectable TEC modules to trade power vs\noutput. Prototype design targets ~0.28–0.33 L/h at 70 % RH under ideal conditions, with\ndistillation up to ~0.25 L/h possible when boiling. This concept bridges atmospheric water\ngeneration and small-scale distillation in one compact, rugged package.\nUnlike pure AWG units that waste heat, the Hydro Cube stands apart by converting cold and hot\nsides into productive functions. Compared to other military/AWG programs (e.g., DARPA\nAWE, GE’s AIR2WATER, SOURCE Hydropanels), the Hydro Cube’s size, dual use, and\nmodular power control give tactical flexibility and competitive performance in the portable class.\n2. System Design & Architecture\n2.1 Geometry & Deployment\n• Stowed configuration: 5″ × 5″ × 5″ cube\n• Deployed configuration: 5″ × 5″ × 11″ column\n• The top shell houses an optional use 44 CFM updraft fan that draws air from bottom\nfiltered vents, pulls it through the fin array upward, and exhausts via a chimney.\n• The fin pack footprint is 4″ depth × 3.25″ width (usable width ≈ 76.5 mm after side\nrails). 33 fins (0.8–1.0 mm thick) with 1.5 mm gaps give a dense, high-area condensing\ncore.\n2.2 Cold Side & Condensation\n• The cold plate is a 4″×4″×¼″ Al-6061 spreader bonded to TEC modules (TEC1-12706).\n• The fin stack (“33 fins × 6″ tall”) is mounted directly to the cold spreader. Each fin (both\nfaces) yields 4″×6″ → 48 in² raw.\n• Effective wet condensing area (with hydrophilic finish & droplet shedding) is estimated\nat ~0.55–0.60 m².\n\n• The optional top fan ensures good airflow renewal over each channel (~44 CFM total →\n~1.3–1.4 CFM per channel), sustaining condensation flux.\n2.3 Hot Side & Immersed Heatsink / Distillation Bath\n• Instead of a passive water jacket, the hot side is realized via a finned heatsink immersed\nin a small, sealed liquid reservoir (e.g., distilled water or condensate).\n• The hot-side fins or pins are submerged in liquid; as the TEC pumps heat into the sink, it\ncan drive local boiling at the interface, turning that same liquid into steam.\n• That steam is directed into a condensation path (over the cold fin array) to produce\ndistilled output, or condensed back into potable water.\n• This design yields synergy: the liquid bath removes waste heat while simultaneously\nserving as the working mass to be boiled/distilled.\n• Control of TEC power is essential to avoid overheating; active derating above ~70 °C at\nthe interface is recommended.\n2.4 Power, Controls & Modularity\n• The cold plate is powered by up to 4 TEC1-12706 modules (12 V, ~60 W each).\n• The system includes a switch/control bank to enable 1, 2, 3, or 4 TECs, depending on\ndesired yield vs. runtime.\n• Control logic monitors hot-face NTC, liquid bath temperature, and ensures safe\noperation (derate, shutdown).\n• All operation is powered electrically—no external heater or fuel source is required;\nboiling is achieved from TEC waste heat.\n2.5 UV-C Sterilization Subsystem\nThe Hydro Cube integrates a UV-C mini-LED sterilization system designed to ensure complete\nmicrobial control within the unit’s air and water pathways. The UV-C system employs compact\n265–275 nm emitters with optical outputs of 20–30 mW per diode. These LEDs are strategically\nlocated in three primary zones:\n1. Condensate Fin Array: 6–8 LEDs mounted vertically along the fin pack’s sides, angled\ninward 30–40°, irradiate condensation surfaces, and prevent biofilm formation.\n2. Collection Basin / Distillation Cup: Two downward–facing LEDs are positioned within\nthe upper rim to sterilize the stored condensate or distilled water.\n3. Airflow / Fan Chamber – 2 LEDs embedded in the upper shell near the exhaust vent to\nprevent microbial buildup in air-handling components\nThe subsystem draws less than 0.75 W (at 5 V) and operates through a 12 V→5 V step-down\nconverter. The UV-C cycle may run intermittently (2 min on / 15 min off) or continuously,\ndepending on mission parameters. Reflective baffles and optical isolation ensure operator safety\nand high irradiance efficiency.\n\nPerformance Gains:\n• Delivers sterile water (< 10 CFU/mL).\n• Reduces fin biofouling frequency by > 75%.\n• Extends water storage life from 24 h to 72 h+.\n• Adds < 3 % power draw / < 15 g mass.\n3. Performance Estimates\nThese are target estimates suitable for concept-level justification. Real performance will depend\non fabrication tolerances, surface finishes, and test conditions.\n3.1 Atmospheric Condensation Mode (Clean Water Output)\nAssume ambient 30 °C, sealed shroud, 44 CFM, 33 fins × 1.5 mm spacing, liquid-cooled hot\nsink (immersed).\nRelative Humidity L/h, 4 TECs L/day, 4 TECs L/h, 3 TECs L/h, 2 TECs\n60 % 0.20 – 0.24 4.8 – 5.8 0.15 – 0.18 0.10 – 0.13\n70 % 0.28 – 0.33 6.7 – 8.0 0.21 – 0.25 0.14 – 0.18\n80 % 0.34 – 0.40 8.2 – 9.6 0.26 – 0.32 0.18 – 0.24\n90 % 0.38 – 0.45 9.1 – 10.8 0.30 – 0.35 0.22 – 0.28\n• These yields reflect the additional condensing area and high airflow renewal.\n• Gains beyond ~85–90% will flatten as TEC heat-lift capacity becomes the limiting factor.\n3.2 Distillation / Boiling Mode (Dirty Water Processing)\n• The immersed heatsink hot side can reach boiling in local zones if TECs supply ~300–\n360+ W of heat.\n• With 4 TECs, Qh ≈ Qc + Pin ≈ 350–420 W, leaving enough latent energy to support\n~0.20–0.25 L/h of distillation from contaminated water (contingent on HX design and\nminimal thermal losses).\n• With 3 TECs, expect ~0.15–0.18 L/h; with 2 TECs, ~0.10–0.12 L/h.\n• In hybrid duty cycles, the system may alternate between condensing and distillation\nphases to maintain temperatures and yield.\n\n3.3 Cold Climate / Low Temperature Performance\nPerformance drops as humidity (absolute) decreases. For ambient ~20 °C:\n• At 70 % RH (~14 g/m³ vapor), yields might drop by ~25–35%.\n• For example: 0.28 L/h (warm) → ~0.18–0.22 L/h in cooler air.\n• Distillation is less affected (since boiling is actively driven), but heat losses grow.\nThese estimates assume good insulation, low parasitic heat paths, and precise thermal control.\n4. Biosecurity & Hygiene Advantages\nThe UV-C subsystem enhances the Hydro Cube’s field readiness by eliminating biological\ncontamination and maintaining sterile operation without filters or chemicals. This silent,\nmaintenance-free solution ensures operational safety for special-forces personnel, forward\noperators, or disaster-response teams in regions lacking medical or cleaning resources.\n5. Applications and Deployment\n• DoD & SOF Use: Tactical water independence for small units or unmanned platforms.\n• FEMA / DHS: Emergency shelters and mobile command units.\n• Humanitarian Operations: Rapid-response water generation from humid or coastal air.\n• Commercial: Basecamp, expeditionary, camping, recreational, or survival applications.\n6. Cost and Production\nComponent Estimated Cost per Unit (10,000 units)\nTEC Array (×4) $20\nAluminum Housing + Fins $15\nLiquid Heatsink Assembly $10\nUV-C LED Subsystem $9\nElectronics + Battery $12\nAssembly / QA $14\nTotal (Approx.) $80 per unit\n\n7. Comparisons to Existing Programs & Commercial AWG Efforts\nTo show how The Hydro Cube fits the broader R&D and market space:\n• DARPA AWE (Atmospheric Water Extraction)\nGoal: build lightweight, low-power systems that supply potable water even in arid\no\nzones. (darpa.mil)\nMultiple contracts to GE, Honeywell, MIT, PSI, NRL, etc. (darpa.mil)\no\nGE’s AIR2WATER project under AWE aims to produce hundreds of liters/day\no\nfrom deployed systems. (GE)\nAWE encourages sorbent-based approaches (adsorb-desorb cycles) to lower\no\nenergy per liter in dry ambient conditions. (darpa.mil)\nExample: DARPA’s distillation-enabled AWE challenge requires devices that\no\noperate even in extremely low humidity, imposing a higher standard of SWaP\n(size, weight, and power) (idstch.com)\n• SOURCE Hydropanels (Zero Mass Water / SOURCE Global)\nUses solar-powered hygroscopic capture + passive condensation — no external\no\npower grid needed. (SOURCE)\nEffective in moderate RH environments; scale is non-tactical (rooftop panels,\no\nhomes) rather than personal systems. (SOURCE)\nSOURCE claims to mineralize and ozonate output for taste/sterility. (SOURCE)\no\nCritics note cost efficiency and performance limits at low humidity, but they\no\nillustrate how passive/solar AWG is entering the market. (The Guardian)\n• Navy AWG-OTM (On The Move)\nA U.S. Marine Corps SBIR topic: portable AWG system producing ~24 gallons\no\nin 24 hours (~90 L/day) for a small team using onboard power (vehicle)\n(navysbir.com)\nEmphasis is on vehicular/vehicle-integrated systems, not wearable or individual\no\nscale.\nThese benchmarks show that while large systems target tens to hundreds of liters per day, the\nsmall, self-contained, individual-scale niche remains underexplored. The Hydro Cube aims to fill\nthat gap by combining condensation and distillation in one, with modular power scaling and\nadvantageous compactness.\n8. Operational & Tactical Advantages\n• Dual-use thermodynamics: Both cold and hot sides are harnessed for water production\nrather than waste heat rejection alone.\n• Flexible scaling: Operator can disable TEC modules to conserve battery or modulate\noutput as conditions vary.\n• Low signature & silent operation: No compressors, no flue exhaust, modest fan noise.\n• Reduced logistics burden: Less water transport, fewer resupply convoys, lower heat/fuel\nfootprints.\n\n• Boiling/hygiene capability built-in: Distillation from dirty sources or localized\nsterilization of condensate fluid.\n• Competitive in DARPA/DoD space: Personal class systems are exactly the\n“expeditionary track” goal of AWE.\n9. Risks, Challenges & Mitigations\n• Heat leaks & non-ideal thermal paths reduce COP — careful sealing and insulation\nrequired.\n• Boil detachment and bubble formation in an immersed heatsink may reduce thermal\ncoupling, so a robust boiling surface design (micro-fins, nucleation sites) is needed.\n• Water quality concerns in distillation mode: ensure materials are inert and path is sealed\nto avoid contamination.\n• Power constraints in low-RH conditions: output falls rapidly with RH drop. Mitigation:\nuse local heating cycles.\n• Durability & fouling: repeated condensation cycles risk corrosion or fouling of fins or\nimmersion surfaces; coatings and maintenance protocols are essential.\n10. Development Roadmap & Cost Estimate\nPhase I – Prototype Demonstration\n• Build a benchtop with a 33-fin array, 4 TEC modules, and an immersed heatsink.\nValidate condensation and distillation rates vs. targets.\n• Thermal mapping, flow calibration, and durability cycles.\nPhase II – Rugged Field Prototype\n• Reinforced shell, deployable mechanisms, filtration modules, connectors, field sealing,\nenvironmental tests (dust, shock, salt fog).\nPhase III – Pre-Production & Field Trials\n• Small batch (1,000–10,000 units) production, user field evaluation, integration into\nsoldier systems.\n\n11. Conclusion\nThe Hydro Cube merges solid-state reliability, UV-C sterilization, and dual-mode heat\nutilization into a single, compact system. Its modular design allows adaptation from field kits to\nvehicle-mounted units. By maintaining potable, sterile water generation in the most austere\nenvironments, it directly supports U.S. DoD logistics reduction initiatives, NATO field resilience\nefforts, and humanitarian disaster-relief operations worldwide.\nBlue Planet Filtration • Stonington, CT • (860)917-6478 • jgeraci@blueplanetfiltration.com\n\n",
