## Advanced Foam Fractionation Technology for DoD Applications

**Analysis Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Classification:** Open Source Intelligence  
**Status:** Urgent Analysis - Phase 1 (Technology Assessment)  
**Confidence Level:** Initial Assessment

---

## SITUATION ASSESSMENT

**Technology Overview:** Advanced foam fractionation system for contaminant removal from fresh and saltwater  
**Operational Basis:** Field-tested at Cape location (testing validation complete)

- Scalable from personal to facility installation
- Low chemical footprint
- Energy-efficient vs. traditional filtration

### Identified Contaminant Removal Targets
- Dissolved organic matter (humic substances, microplastics)
- Biological contaminants (indicated by comparative QSMEC applications)

## RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Technical Validation & IP Protection (Next 90 Days)
**Objective:** Secure intellectual property; validate scalability claims

**Actions:**
1. File provisional patent applications on foam fractionation optimization methodology
2. Conduct comparative performance analysis vs. RO/ultrafiltration (energy/cost/effectiveness)
3. Document Cape testing results formally
4. Identify specific DoD pain points (requirements gathering with Navy/Army)

**Deliverable:** Technical white paper + patent specification documents

### Phase 2: Military Market Entry (Months 4-8)
**Objective:** Establish DoD procurement pathway

**Actions:**
1. SBIR Phase I proposal targeting Navy/Army water systems solicitations
2. Initiate conversations with Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) and Army Corps of Engineers
3. Conduct field testing at DoD facility (coordinate through SBIR process)
4. Develop MILSPEC/COTS integration documentation

**Deliverable:** SBIR Phase I award (target: $150K-$250K funding)

### Phase 3: Scaled Deployment (Months 9-18)
**Objective:** Demonstrate operational capability at scale

**Actions:**
1. Field pilot at Navy base or Army facility
2. Integration testing with existing infrastructure
3. Operational metrics documentation
4. Cost analysis and lifecycle economics

**Deliverable:** SBIR Phase II proposal ($750K-$1.5M) + pilot results

## QSMEC INTEGRATION POTENTIAL

### Sensing & Monitoring Opportunities
- **Real-time contaminant detection:** QSMEC optical/spectroscopic sensors for water quality monitoring
- **System efficiency tracking:** Foam generation optimization via QSMEC monitoring
- **Field diagnostics:** Rapid water purity assessment (complementary to filtration)

### Dual-Innovation Approach
