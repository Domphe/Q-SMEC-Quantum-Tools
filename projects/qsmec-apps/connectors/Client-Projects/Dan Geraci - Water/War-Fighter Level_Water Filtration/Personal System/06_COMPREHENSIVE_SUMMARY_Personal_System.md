## System Snapshot

- **Capability:** Dual fresh/saltwater purification; >99.9% bio and >95% chemical removal; <0.5 NTU.  
- **Energy:** 0.05–0.15 kWh/gal (3–5× lower than RO).  
- **Weight/Power:** <5 lbs; 50–150W; battery/solar/vehicle/wall.  
- **Reliability:** 99.5% uptime (30-day Cape); predictive maintenance reduces downtime 50%.  
- **Maintenance:** 2-minute filter swap; filter life 500–1,000 gal; UV 10,000 hrs.  
- **TRL:** 6–7; field validated; P248/MIL-STD plan in flight.  
- **Telemetry:** QSMEC 8-sensor suite with edge analytics; optional app “War-Fighter H2O.”

## Evidence Base (Cape Test Highlights)

- 30-day continuous run, fresh + saltwater.  
- 500+ samples; uptime 99.5%.  
- Alert precision 82%, recall 76% for predictive maintenance.  
- Survived mud/silt, on/off cycles (50), and voltage sag with mitigations applied.

---

## Mission Value

- **Operational Freedom:** Removes reliance on water convoys; extends range and dwell.  
- **Risk Reduction:** Fewer resupply exposures; chemical threat coverage beyond tablets/filters.  
- **Energy Fit:** Works within small-unit power budgets; solar/battery compatible.  
- **Speed & Simplicity:** 2-minute deployment; minimal training burden.

---

## Commercial & Procurement Path

- **Primary:** SBIR Navy N25-2 (Jan 22, 2026); prepare A25-2 (Feb) and SOCOM H25-2 (Mar).  
- **Pilots:** SOCOM, MEUs, Ranger battalions; 5–10 demo units with telemetry dashboards.  
- **Primes:** L3Harris, RTX, Collins for channel and sustainment.  
- **Pricing:** ~$2,500 unit (1k+); TCO ~$4,100 over 5 years @ 1,000 gal/yr.

---

## Roadmap & Risks

- **Short Term (0–90 days):** Submit SBIR; finalize P248 test schedule; issue maintenance card and quick-start; lock BOM; ship pilot kits.  
- **Mid Term (2026–2027):** Pilot build 25–50 units; LRIP 1,000 units; expand sensor drift study to 60–90 days; add secure boot/OTA.  
- **Long Term (2028–2029):** FRP 10,000 units with primes; integrate with soldier systems telemetry backends.  
- **Risks:** Certification timing; supply chain for sensors/UV; field training adherence; OPSEC for telemetry.  
- **Mitigations:** Dual-source sensors/UV; offline-first telemetry; signed firmware; Berry-compliant harness; formal training module.

## Conclusion

The personal system is a validated, energy-light, saltwater-capable purifier that directly addresses the individual soldier hydration gap. With SBIR timing and Cape-proven performance, it is ready for pilot deployments now and scalable to 1,000-unit LRIP in 2027 and FRP by 2028–2029 through prime partnerships.
