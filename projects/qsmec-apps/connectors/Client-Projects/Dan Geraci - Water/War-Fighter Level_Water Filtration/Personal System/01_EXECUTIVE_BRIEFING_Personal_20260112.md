# EXECUTIVE BRIEFING: PERSONAL WAR-FIGHTER WATER SYSTEM

## Individual Soldier Hydration Independence Strategy

**Analysis Date:** January 12, 2026  
**System:** Personal-level foam fractionation purifier (1–10 GPD)  
**Classification:** Open Source Intelligence  
**Confidence:** High (Cape testing validated)

---

## Situation Assessment

**Gap:** Individual soldiers lack energy-efficient, chemical-capable purification that works on both fresh and saltwater without logistics tail.  
**Market Timing:** SBIR window (Navy N25-2 due Jan 22, 2026) + Army/SOCOM topics pending.  
**Technology Readiness:** TRL 6–7 (30-day Cape test, 99.5% uptime, >99.9% bio / >95% chem removal).  
**Weight & Power:** <5 lbs, 50–150W; battery/solar/vehicle compatible.

## Unique Value Proposition

- **Dual-Environment:** Fresh + saltwater, no reconfiguration.  
- **Energy Advantage:** 3–5× more efficient than RO (0.05–0.15 kWh/gal).  
- **Portability:** Backpack/MOLLE, 2-minute deployment.  
- **Simplicity:** Filter swap every 500–1,000 gal; UV 10,000 hrs; no membranes.  
- **Intelligence:** QSMEC 8-sensor suite with predictive maintenance (50% downtime reduction).  
- **Protection:** >99.9% biological, >95% chemical removal; <0.5 NTU clarity.

## Recommended Strategy

1) **Primary Entry:** SBIR Phase I (Navy N25-2) focused on personal system; parallel Army A25-2 & SOCOM H25-2.  
2) **Pilot Users:** SOCOM teams, Marine Expeditionary Units, Army Ranger battalions.  
3) **Partnering:** Primes for soldier systems (L3Harris, RTX) + Natick/SOCOM labs for validation.  
4) **Certifications:** Target NSF P248 + MIL-STD-810H environmental; document TB MED 577 compliance.  
5) **Scale Plan:** 1,000-unit LRIP by 2027; 10,000-unit FRP by 2028–2029.

## Investment & Financials

- **Unit Cost (1k+ units):** $2,500; MSRP ~$3,500.  
- **TCO (5 years @ 1,000 gal/yr):** $4,100 total; $0.82/gal.  
- **Savings vs. Bottled Water:** $389–$839 per soldier per month.  
- **Battalion Annual Savings (800 troops):** $3.7M–$8.0M.  
- **SBIR Funding Path:** $150–$250K (Phase I), $750K–$1.5M (Phase II).

---

## Key Success Factors

- Demonstrate 1–10 GPD fresh/saltwater in field conditions.  
- Maintain energy ≤0.15 kWh/gal; uptime ≥99% over 30 days.  
- Validate QSMEC predictive alerts (≥80% accurate).  
- Achieve filter life 500–1,000 gal; UV ≥10,000 hrs.  
- Secure at least one prime teaming agreement (Navy/Army/SOCOM channel).  
- Complete P248/MIL-STD test plan and schedule with certified labs.

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Jan 2026)

- Finalize SBIR technical/business volumes (personal focus) by **Jan 20–21**.  
- File provisional patents (method + apparatus) by **Jan 20**.  
- Prepare 5 demo kits for SOCOM/Natick; schedule Q2 evaluations.  
- Lock COTS vendor list (Berry-compliant) and spare parts kit (10% float).  
- Publish soldier quick-start + maintenance card (2 pages).  
- Stand up mobile app “War-Fighter H2O” beta for QSMEC telemetry.

## Executive Outlook

The personal system is a force-multiplier: it removes water logistics as a constraint, cuts convoy exposure, and enables long-duration missions without resupply. With SBIR as the entry ramp and validated Cape performance, we can move to 1,000-unit LRIP in 2027 and full-rate production by 2028–2029 if we secure Phase II and prime partnerships now.
