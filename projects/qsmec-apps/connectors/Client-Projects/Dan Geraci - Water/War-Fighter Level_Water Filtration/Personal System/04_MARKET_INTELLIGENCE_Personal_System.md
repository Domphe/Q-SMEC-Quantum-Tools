# MARKET INTELLIGENCE: PERSONAL WAR-FIGHTER WATER SYSTEM

**Scope:** Individual soldier hydration (personal purifier, 1–10 GPD)  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Use Cases:** SOCOM teams, MEUs, Ranger/infantry squads, disaster response forward teams

---

## Demand Signals

- **Logistics Risk:** Water resupply convoys are high-risk; personal purification reduces convoy frequency.  
- **Energy Budgets:** Small unit power is limited; current RO/UV kits are power-heavy or only fresh-water capable.  
- **Chemical Threats:** Elevated concern for industrial pollutants and chemical agents in AO—current tablets/filters insufficient.  
- **Salt/Fresh Flex:** Littoral and riverine ops need both without swapping hardware.

---

## Competitive Landscape (Personal Scale)

- **RO Pump Kits:** High energy, prone to fouling; typically fresh-water focused.  
- **Inline Filters/Tablets:** Limited chemical removal; not effective on saltwater; bio-only.  
- **UV Pens/Bottles:** Disinfect but do not remove chemicals or particulates.  
- **Foam Fractionation (Our Approach):** Dual fresh/salt, low energy, chemical + bio removal, minimal maintenance.

**Differentiators:**  
- Dual-environment support (fresh + salt) with no reconfiguration.  
- 3–5× lower energy than RO (0.05–0.15 kWh/gal).  
- Integrated predictive maintenance and telemetry (QSMEC).  
- Lightweight (<5 lbs) and fast setup (2 minutes).

## Procurement & Pathways

- **SBIR:** Navy N25-2 (due Jan 22, 2026); Army A25-2 expected Feb; SOCOM H25-2 expected Mar.  
- **OTAs:** Soldier systems; small quantity rapid buys for pilots.  
- **Labs:** Natick, SOCOM, Marine Corps Warfighting Lab for user evals.  
- **Primes:** L3Harris, RTX, Collins—soldier systems channels for scaling and sustainment.

---

## Pricing & Economics

- **Target Unit (1k+ units):** ~$2,500; MSRP ~$3,500.  
- **TCO (5 years @ 1,000 gal/yr):** ~$4,100; ~$0.82/gal.  
- **Savings vs. Bottled:** $389–$839 per soldier per month depending on theater logistics.  
- **Pilot Kits:** 10–50 units for SOCOM/Natick; bundle spare filters (10% float) + battery/solar kit.

---

## Customer Objections & Responses

- **“Saltwater capable?”** Yes, validated; no membrane fouling.  
- **“Power draw?”** 50–150W; compatible with solar/battery/vehicle; low-power mode.  
- **“Maintenance burden?”** 2-minute filter swap, weekly rinse; predictive alerts reduce downtime 50%.  
- **“Chemical threats?”** >95% chemical removal; foam fractionation + UV polishing.  
- **“Certification?”** P248 and MIL-STD-810H test plan in flight; Cape test completed.

## Go-to-Market Moves (Next 60–90 Days)

- Submit SBIR N25-2 personal-system package; prep for A25-2/SOCOM topics.  
- Ship 5–10 demo units to SOCOM/Natick with telemetry dashboards.  
- Publish 2-page soldier quick-start + maintenance card.  
- Lock BOM and vendor list (Berry-compliant harness).  
- Create field training module (30 minutes) and offline app workflow.

## Outlook

Personal-scale purification that is saltwater-capable, energy-light, and chemically robust is under-served. With validated Cape performance and SBIR timing, we can capture early pilots now and scale through primes in 2027–2028 while owning the telemetry and maintenance advantage.
