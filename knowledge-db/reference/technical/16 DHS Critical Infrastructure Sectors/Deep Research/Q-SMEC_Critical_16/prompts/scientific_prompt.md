# Scientific Prompt — Very Granular

Objective: Evaluate physical principles enabling Q-SMEC-class sensors and energy containment.

Modules:
- Quantum transport: superconductivity, flux quantization Φ₀=h/2e, phase coherence, quantum capacitance C_q=e²(dN/dμ).
- Noise theory: Johnson-Nyquist, 1/f mechanisms, device-level mitigation.
- Materials: heterostructures, deposition constraints (ALD/PVD/CVD), surface roughness targets, cryogenic windows.
- Measurement methodology: repeatable bench setups, calibration, uncertainty budgets.
- Validation: define test protocols that separate device physics from system confounders.

Outputs:
- Methods section templates.
- Data dictionary for physics experiments.
- Checklist for reproducibility and lab notebooks.
