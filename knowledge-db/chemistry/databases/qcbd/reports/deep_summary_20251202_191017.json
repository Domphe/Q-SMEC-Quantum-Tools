It highlights unique physical properties (quantum\u2011level energy containment and enhanced sensor sensitivity), shows that the technology is compatible with existing manufacturing infrastructure, and outlines a modular material toolkit that can be tuned via AI\u2011assisted design.",
          "2. Engineering / Development Pathway",
          "The Statement of Work (Section E) defines a six\u2011task non\u2011recurring engineering (NRE) process for each Q\u2011SMEC instantiation. These tasks provide a predictable timeline, cost and engineering\u2011hours estimate, and later details give specifics for Tasks 4\u20136:",
          "Total NRE per instantiation is up to 54\u202fweeks, 7\u202f700\u202fengineering hours and approximately $770\u202fK.",
          "Investor implication: The staged TRL/MRL pathway provides clarity on cost and schedule, reassuring partners that each use case can be advanced from concept to production in about one year with a well\u2011defined budget.",
          "3. IP and Licensing Structure",
          "Licensing model: Q\u2011SMEC will offer both exclusive and non\u2011exclusive licenses, defined by field of use, geographical territory, and critical\u2011infrastructure sector. Each license involves an up\u2011front fee and a small recurring quarterly royalty; a minimum quarterly royalty is required. The license pricing is aligned to the Net Present Value (NPV) analysis performed for each use case (see Section D of the white paper).",
          "Joint IP ownership: Co\u2011investors who fund specific instantiations can acquire joint intellectual\u2011property ownership.",
          "Availability for licensing: Each customized sensor becomes eligible for licensing once it reaches Task 4 or higher, meaning that partners can secure rights after the manufacturability beta stage.",
          "Investor implication: The revenue model mirrors those of IP\u2011licensing firms like ARM or Dolby: low capital outlay, multiple revenue streams (up\u2011front plus royalties), and the ability to tailor licenses by sector and geography. Joint\u2011IP provisions also incentivize strategic investors.",
          "4. Sectoral Use\u2011Case Layer",
          "The paper assesses Q\u2011SMEC\u2019s potential across the sixteen DHS critical\u2011infrastructure sectors. Below are highlights of the largest or fastest\u2011growing segments (addressable markets and CAGRs are taken from Section D):",
          "4.1 Defense & Intelligence",
          "ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance): Market ~$7.3\u202fB/year with 15\u202f% CAGR; NPV for a 1M\u2011patent license is $3.3\u202fB.",
          "Navigation & guidance: IMUs, GNSS and AHRS applications yield a $18.7\u202fB/year market with 7\u202f% CAGR and $3.4\u202fB NPV.",
          "Weapon systems/targeting: Targeting pods and missile seekers constitute a $9\u202fB/year market, 6\u202f% CAGR.",
          "Electronic warfare: $16.6\u202fB/year, 7\u202f% CAGR.",
          "Platform control & monitoring (flight controls, propulsion, and structural\u2011health monitoring): $11\u202fB/year, 5\u202f% CAGR.",
          "Sensor\u2011type breakdown: EO/IR sensors ($13.8\u202fB, 5\u202f% CAGR); radar sensors including LIDAR ($12\u202fB, 5\u202f% CAGR); inertial sensors ($12\u202fB, 5\u202f% CAGR); pressure sensors ($2.9\u202fB, 8.2\u202f% CAGR); acoustic/sonar sensors ($1.8\u202fB, 5\u202f% CAGR); chemical/biological sensors ($2.1\u202fB, 5\u202f% CAGR).
