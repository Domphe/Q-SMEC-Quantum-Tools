# Targeted Next Steps

## THz Detector Benchmarks
- Collect and normalize THz metrics (NEP, responsivity, bandwidth, dynamic range) from referenced pitch decks and docx samples.
- Cross-verify with peer-reviewed references indicated in 'peer-reviewed benchmarks' sources.
- Map to QCBD sets: THz-Response, SCONF21 for optical/material coupling.

## Prussian Blue (PB/PBA) Battery Targets
- Extract energy density (Wh/kg), cycle life, rate capability and voltage profiles from Gap Analysis and Verified Benchmarks sections.
- Align targets against Battery24 set; flag gaps where proposal exceeds current verified performance.
- Create overlay charts in `reports/` with proposal vs. verified ranges.

## Materials and Methods Inserts
- Add materials: GaN, AlN, graphene, Nb, Ti, Ge, Prussian Blue/PBA to registry with linked sources.
- Add methods: DFT, HSE06, THz measurement, DOE to methods table with provenance.
- Associate dataset entries with source paths for reproducibility.

## Immediate Actions
- Approve proposed inserts JSON for ingestion into QCBD.
- Schedule data extraction for THz and PB benchmarks; generate normalized CSVs.
- Update materials taxonomy in docs with cross-root coverage summary.
