Such states have maximal bipartite entanglement and serve as a useful platform for studying the quench dynamics of systems which have large initial entanglement. In this paper, we study a generalization of these states which we dub entangled mutipodal states. These states, which are defined for fermionic systems, generalize the crosscap states by having correlations among more than two sites, specifically, those which sit at the vertices of regular polygons. By construction, the states are Gaussian and translationally invariant allowing many of their properties to be understood. We study the bipartite entanglement entropy of these states both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium, the entanglement profile as a function of subsystem size exhibits two distinct regimes, a volume-law growth followed by a saturation to a constant value, thus generalizing the Page-curve profile of the crosscap state. In the non-equilibrium setting, we study quenches from these initial states to the free-fermion chain, whose ensuing dynamics displays a far richer structure compared to the crosscap case. We interpret our results in terms of the quasiparticle picture, which requires multiplets of quasiparticles to be excited non-locally around the system.

In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\\lceil \\log_2 (V)\\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures.

However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations.

We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane.

Operating entirely below 3 dB of input squeezing, the approach provides a scalable, experimentally accessible platform that unites the state resources required for quantum communication, metrology, and computation within one coherent optical framework.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["quant-ph"]}

However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["quant-ph"]}

The framework employs a two-stage quantum self-attention module that computes contextual dependencies by mapping architectural parameters through parameterized quantum circuits, replacing classical similarity metrics with quantum-derived attention scores, then applies position-wise quantum transformations for feature enrichment. Architecture search is guided by a task-agnostic multi-objective function jointly optimizing noisy expressibility and Probability of Successful Trials (PST).

Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$.

Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations.

This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction.

Despite rapid progress in hardware development, we still lack useful applications that are feasible for the next generation of quantum computers.

However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states.

By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code.

Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem.

Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF.

Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes.

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy.

The mechanisms governing C incorporation and its impact on film growth and properties in hPLD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of C-containing side products generated from organosulfur precursor pyrolysis on ZnS, BaTiS$_3$, and TiS$_2$ thin films grown by hPLD using tert-butyl disulfide (TBDS). Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, combined with secondary ion mass spectrometry, is used to systematically examine the effects of growth temperature and TBDS partial pressure on film morphology, crystallinity, and C incorporation. Optimal growth temperatures of 400°C, 500°C, and 700°C are identified for ZnS, TiS$_2$, and BaTiS$_3$, respectively. Growth above or below these temperatures leads to increased C incorporation at both the interface and within the film, correlating with degraded texture. In contrast, highly textured films exhibit minimal C content, comparable to films grown without TBDS. For TiS$_2$, C incorporation depends strongly on TBDS pressure, with 10$^{-1}$ Pa identified as the optimal pressure for minimizing contamination. At higher pressures, loss of preferential texture is observed, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk.

We examine the challenges posed by quantum confinement, anisotropic screening, and van der Waals interactions, which conventional functionals often fail to describe. Advanced approaches, including meta-GGA, hybrid functionals, and many-body perturbation theory (e.g., GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation), are assessed for their improved accuracy in capturing electronic structure and excitonic effects. We further discuss the non-universality of functionals across different 2D material families and the emerging role of machine learning to enhance computational efficiency.

Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability.

ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling.

Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the $α$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\\bar{2}]$-notched $α$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions.

The SR-derived models (SR1 and SR2) reproduced key material properties - lattice constants, cohesive energies, equations of state, elastic constants, phonon dispersion, defect formation energies, surface/bulk energetics, and phase transformation with significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, stringent melting simulations using two-phase solid-amorphous interfaces confirmed that SR models accurately capture the interplay of vibrational entropy, cohesive energy, and structural dynamics, surpassing SC-EAM in both qualitative and quantitative predictions.

The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures.

The structure can be derived from a hexagonal prototype $R$Fe$_3$Ge$_2$ by replacing every other $R$ atom with a covalent Ge$_2$ dimer. Ordering of these dimers renders the structure orthorhombic, slightly distorts the kagome net, and makes the three Fe sites formally inequivalent. The iron and rare-earth sublattices order independently. Fe moments order above 400 K, forming ferromagnetic kagome planes stacked antiferromagnetically, while rare-earth moments order below 9 K. TbFe$_6$Ge$_6$ exhibits a single magnetic ordering transition associated with the Tb atoms, whereas DyFe$_6$Ge$_6$ shows two distinct magnetic phase transitions, strongly influenced by crystal electric field effects on the Dy$^{3+}$ ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the ferromagnetic ordering of the Fe planes is driven by a high density of states at the Fermi energy. They also reveal three dramatically different structural energy scales: $R$ and Ge$_2$ form alternating 1D chains perpendicular to the kagome planes, and violating this alternation incurs a large energy cost.

The layers in their pristine form exhibit positive adsorption energies, indicating an endothermic nature. Substitution of a dopant in the pristine MSSe layers alters the local symmetry, bonding character, and charge distribution, thereby increasing the number of active sites for hosting H adsorption and reducing the adsorption energy. We select distinct sites, both atomic and interstitial, for the substitution of dopants. The energetics of the H atom at various sites is studied to find the most favorable active site on the MSSe Janus layers. Our results based on density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption process becomes spontaneous and less attractive in the presence of atomic site dopant substitution, whereas the interstitial site results in an endothermic behavior. Moreover, having the data from DFT, we develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting the hydrogen adsorption energy. For this purpose, we utilize 23 elemental features of the atoms involved in the structure, thereby eliminating the need for DFT calculations in feature design.

Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["cond-mat.mtrl-sci"]}

We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator.

The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge would either shift it to a field free region or eject it from the trap. This constraint appears to make single ion quantum-logic clocks, among the most precise measurement devices available, incompatible with EDM measurements. Here, we demonstrate that, under typical trapping conditions, heavy molecular ions with small $Ω/Λ$-doubling can be polarized by a static electric field while remaining confined in the Paul trap. This effect arises from a cancellation between the electrostatic force and the trap's ponderomotive force, resulting in an equilibrium position where the ion experiences a dc electric field component. Dynamic decoupling allows to implement co-magnetometry schemes in a single molecule and provides long interrogation times. This will allow the operation of a quantum-logic molecular radio-frequency clock in static electric fields, providing sensitivity to EDMs. Working with only a few ions and non-destructive detection techniques opens the door to the use of highly sensitive, rare, and radioactive molecular species as well as quantum-enhanced metrology schemes to achieve unprecedented levels of accuracy and precision.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.atom-ph"]}

It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions.

The frequency degeneracy between clock- and anticlock-wise sound modes is lifted upon controllably injecting a quantized supercurrent in the superfluid ring, resulting in a measurable Doppler shift that enables us to probe the elementary quantum of circulation and the angular momentum carried by each particle in the fermionic fluid. Our observations directly reveal that the superflow circulation is quantized in terms of $h/2m$, where $m$ is the mass of the constituents, in striking contrast to bosonic condensates where $h/m$ is the relevant circulation quantum. Further, by operating our interferometer at tunable temperature, we measure the thermal depletion of the superfluid in the unitary Fermi gas, demonstrating phonon interferometry as a powerful technique for probing fundamental properties of strongly-correlated quantum systems.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.atom-ph"]}

In this work, we identify a new source of frequency shift and relaxation in the 3He nuclear spin, arising from the light shift.

In the 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the system in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in the terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective super-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition. As the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident signal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar idler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture is into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific, highly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane. Outside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum devices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive resonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and obtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict transduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while the overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher.

For these applications the lifetime of the Rydberg levels sets fundamental limits for gate fidelities, coherence times, or spectroscopic precision. The quest for longer Rydberg state lifetimes has motivated the generation, coherent control and trapping of circular Rydberg atoms, which are characterized by the maximally allowed electron orbital momentum and were key to Nobel prize-winning experiments with single atoms and photons. Here, we report the observation of individually trapped circular Rydberg atoms with lifetimes of more than 10 milliseconds, two orders of magnitude longer-lived than the established low angular momentum orbitals.

Such enhancement of the Penning ionization by a static electric field poses both a threat to the stability and a potential control strategy for quantum systems composed of cold Rydberg atoms with micrometer-scale interatomic separations.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.atom-ph"]}

In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussians envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence.

A primary consideration for the feasibility of laser cooling, which determines the efficiency and technical requirements of the process, is the number of excited-state decay pathways leading to vibrational excitations. Therefore, the assessment of the laser-cooling potential of a molecule begins with estimate of the vibrational branching ratios of the first few electronic excited states theoretically to find the optimum cooling scheme. Such calculations, typically done within the BO and harmonic approximations, have suggested that one leading candidate for large, polyatomic molecule laser cooling, alkaline earth phenoxides, can most efficiently be laser-cooled via the third electronically excited C state. Here, we report the first detailed spectroscopic characterization of the C state in CaOPh and SrOPh. We find that nonadiabatic couplings between the A, B, and C states lead to substantial mixing, giving rise to vibronic states that enable additional decay pathways. Based on the intensity ratio of these extra decay channels, we estimate a non-adiabatic coupling strength of 0.1 cm-1. While this coupling strength is small, the large density of vibrational states available at photonic energy scales in a polyatomic molecule leads to significant mixing. Thus, this result is expected to be general for large molecules and implies that only the lowest electronic excited state should be considered when judging the suitability of a molecule for laser cooling.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.atom-ph"]}

Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack.

The exciton spin structure and its modification by an external magnetic field are modeled for different regimes defined by the relative magnitude of the electron-hole exchange interaction (splitting between dark and bright states) and the Zeeman spin splitting. The effects of crystal symmetry and magnetic field orientation with respect to the crystal axes are considered for lead halide perovskite crystals with band gaps in the range 1.4 - 3.5 eV, having different ratios of electron and hole g-factors. For cubic symmetry, in a longitudinal magnetic field, our theory predicts quantum beats between the bright exciton states under linearly polarized excitation and detection, while the dark exciton remains optically inactive. In a transverse magnetic field, all exciton spin states become optically active and can be excited by circularly polarized light. Reduction of the crystal symmetry leads to a zero-field offset of the exciton Larmor precession frequencies, modifying the Zeeman splitting energy dependence on magnetic field. This theoretical framework allows for the extraction of the strength of the exchange interaction and the crystal symmetry. Experimentally, we measure the exciton spin coherence via time-resolved photoluminescence at a temperature of 1.6 K in longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields in orthorhombic MAPbI3 crystals.

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays.

Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.optics"]}

However, current implementations of SEIRA approach mainly rely on complex instruments and scanning components such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and tunable external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC QCLs).

In this work, we demonstrate the scalable integration of mature InGaAs quantum dots embedded in GaAs waveguides onto a low-loss SiN photonic platform, as evidenced by a high processing yield of 94.7% using a commercially available micro-transfer printing tool. These integrated emitters are embedded within a p-i-n heterostructure that allows for noise suppression, near-blinking-free operation and wavelength tunability upon CMOS-level electrical biasing. With this, we pave the way for scalable integration of diverse quantum photonic devices on a single chip.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.optics"]}

Results show that PSHE tuned by δn =-2, 0, +2 has completely different dependent behaviors on LLs, incident angle of incident photons, and magnetic induction intensity.

One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics.

In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \\textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\\text{Sb}_{2}\\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\\times$2 up to 5$\\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.optics"]}

These interactions exert a pivotal influence on the optical response of a weak probe field and pave the way for novel applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we consider a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere coupled to a microwave cavity. The magnon mode of the YIG sphere is directly excited through microwave field coupling, whereas the cavity mode is probed via a weak-field interrogation scheme. The direct interaction of a traveling field with the magnon mode induces gain in the system, thereby establishing non-Hermitian dynamics. The parity-time (PT)-symmetric behavior of a hybrid non-Hermitian CMM is designed and investigated. Eigenvalue spectrum analysis demonstrates that a third-order exceptional point (EP_3) emerges under tunable effective magnon-photon coupling when the traveling field is oriented at an angle of π/2 relative to the cavity's x-axis. The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in a reflected probe field is subsequently examined in such a system. Under balanced gain and loss conditions and in the presence of effective magnon-phonon coupling, tunable effective magnon-photon coupling enables coherent control of the PSHE across the broken PT-symmetric phase, at the EP_3, and in the PT-symmetric phase. Investigation reveals that the PSHE can be significantly enhanced or suppressed via effective magnon-photon coupling.

Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons.

To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise.

Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD.

In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons.

The field still lacks a standardised and comprehensive framework for evaluating MLIP performance. We introduce MLIPAudit, an open, curated and modular benchmarking suite designed to assess the accuracy of MLIP models across a variety of application tasks.

MLIPAudit also provides tools for users to evaluate their models using the same standardised pipeline. A continuously updated leaderboard tracks performance across benchmarks, enabling direct comparison on downstream tasks. By providing a unified, transparent reference framework for model validation and comparison, MLIPAudit aims to foster reproducibility, transparency, and community-driven progress in the development of MLIPs for complex molecular systems.

We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition.

On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.chem-ph"]}

Simulations were conducted via the microkinetic model and kinetic Monte Carlo methods for the scenarios of a Poisson distribution, constant spacing between photons, and coordinated on/off pulsing of photon sources. The time-averaged photocatalytic rate at differential conditions for varying photon flux and temperatures indicated three kinetic regimes described by product thermal desorption control, surface reaction control, and an intermediate kinetic regime with a zero slope Arrhenius plot, consistent with a degree of rate control dominated by the photon arrival frequency (i.e., per-site photon flux).

While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs 39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton positions ($μ= 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($σ$) further quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors highlighted unresolved quantum cusps.

Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations.

To describe resonances accurately, including their coupling to the continuum, methods based on non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be used, which yield complex energies. In this work, we combine the complex absorbing potential (CAP) and complex basis functions (CBF) techniques with the RI-CC2 method. The second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) offers a good balance between accuracy and computational cost by approximating equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory, making it suitable for studying of electronic resonances in larger molecules. The resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation further reduces computational demands without significant loss in accuracy. We investigate the numerical performance of the new complex-energy RI-CC2 methods focusing on temporary anions. Negative electron affinities and decay widths can be computed using the electron-attachment (EA) variant of RI-CC2. For N2, C2H4, CH2O, and HCOOH, EA-CC2 yields affinities about 0.1-0.2 eV smaller than EOM-EA-CCSD, while deviations reach 0.5 eV for larger anions such as uracil, naphthalene, cyanonaphthalene, and pyrene. As a result of these trends, EA-CC2 is in better agreement with experiment for the negative electron affinities than EOM-EA-CCSD for all studied anions. The corresponding resonance widths from EA-CC2 calculations are about 0.05-0.25 eV smaller compared to EOM-EA-CCSD.

To this end, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native AGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for the RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a spin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version developed by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting implementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when executed on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is shown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active space spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely due to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than three-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems is furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12 model comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals. In terms of accuracy, RIC-MRCCSD is carefully compared to second- and approximate fourth-order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theories (NEVPT2, NEVPT4(SD)), to the multireference zeroth-order coupled-electron pair approximation (CEPA(0)), as well as to the IC-MRCCSD from Kohn.

Yet, this expressiveness can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow (MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.", "container_title": "arXiv", "subject": ["physics.chem-ph"]}

We design a simple, nonempirical adiabatic connection and a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional, and we show that the resulting method reproduces the correlation energy of the uniform electron gas over a wide range of densities. When applied to subsets of the GMTKN55 thermochemistry database, OSMI is more accurate on average than MP2 and nonempirical density functionals. Most notably, OSMI provides excellent predictions of the barrier heights we tested, with average errors of less than 2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. Finally, we find that OSMI improves the trade-off between fractional spin and fractional charge errors for bond dissociation curves compared to DFT and MP2.

In the context of neural network-based quantum Monte Carlo (NNQMC), SAAM leverages the expressiveness of deep neural networks to capture electron correlation while enforcing exact spin adaptation via group representation theory. This framework provides a principled route to embed physical priors into otherwise black-box neural network wavefunctions, yielding a compact representation of correlated system with neural network orbitals. Compared with existing treatments of spin in NNQMC, SAAM is more accurate and efficient, achieving exact spin purity without any additional tunable hyperparameters. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply SAAM to study the spin ladder of iron-sulfur clusters, a long-standing challenge for many-body methods due to their dense spectrum of nearly degenerate spin states.

Focusing on the hydrogen molecule, we begin by revisiting the analytical calculations of the original HL model, from which the qualitative physics of bonding and antibonding states can be obtained. Subsequently, we propose including electronic screening effects directly in the original HL wave function. We then compare our proposal with variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) calculations, whose trial wave function allows us to optimize the electronic screening potential as a function of the inter-proton distance.
